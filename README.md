# koala

A scrumptious and delicious mix between oxidation and the letter C that happens to be a programming language.

We all know koalas are very intelligent beings. They are capable of lexing and parsing a very specific set of words and symbols, which turns out to be an excellent skill that is very beneficial in the creation of languages that describe and talk about "computer instructions".

I recently became the proud owner of a real, living koala. And so, I set out to harness it's amazing intelligence, teaching him type deduction, IR generation, and more in the process. The result of my endeavour ended up being this repository, which is why it's named "koala", what a fitting backstory!
